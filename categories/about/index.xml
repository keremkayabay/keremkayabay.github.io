      <description>I am a researcher and developer active in data science and information systems domains. My current research is about finding ways to help transform data-disadvantaged (or underachiever) organizations to use data more effectively. Whenever I find the time, I develop open-source projects that address some of my problems.
In this blog, you will my latest findings. I also write here to clarify my thoughts. You can check out my research at Google Scholar and my projects at GitHub.</description>
