      <description>I am a researcher and developer. Through my work, I wish to empower people and communities.
Academically, I am interested in data-driven organizations. Here are some of the questions I try to answer:

Can a roadmapping technique help transform traditional organizations to use data more effectively?  Whenever I find the time, I build open-source projects.</description>
