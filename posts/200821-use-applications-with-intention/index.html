		<p>We couldn&rsquo;t reach the information we wanted a long time ago. While that&rsquo;s no longer the case, today, we struggle with different problems: Maintaining focus and discovering critical information in noise and clutter. Here I share some of the tricks I employ to overcome these problems. My intention is to update this post, adding more apps and tips.</p>
<h1 id="web-browsers">Web browsers</h1>
<p>Be careful about the amount of time you spend on web sites, especially the addictive ones. Many applications monetize your attention and time, so they use algorithms to steal more of both. Some browser extensions help you browse more intentionally. For example, I&rsquo;ve developed <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/exploding-tabs/">a minimal open-source extension for Firefox</a> using which you can set a countdown for websites. Other extensions provide additional functionality, like productivity reports.</p>
<h1 id="youtube">YouTube</h1>
<p>Change your <a href="https://www.youtube.com/feed/subscriptions">landing page</a> to only see videos from subscribed channels ordered by time. Manage your subscriptions so that you get high-quality and highly relevant content. Control the number of subscriptions so that you get a limited number of videos per day.</p>
<h1 id="gmail">Gmail</h1>
<p>Email is a powerful tool when used right. By default, it is so cluttered that you must work continuously to maintain its useful state.</p>
<p>For emails that you don&rsquo;t want to receive, unsubscribe. If that doesn&rsquo;t work, use &ldquo;Filter messages like this&rdquo; feature, and choose the delete option.</p>
<p>For emails that you opted to receive, use labels and create clutter-free inboxes. For example, I use &ldquo;Filter messages like this&rdquo; feature on all emails that I receive from my newsletter subscriptions and apply the &ldquo;Newsletter&rdquo; label.</p>
<p>For emails that are not important, but you want to keep anyway, also create labels. This time, select the skip inbox option. The browser application gives you the ability to hide the label from the menu.</p>
