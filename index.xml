      <description>I am a researcher and developer. My goal is to empower people and communities.
My academic interest is mainly about data-driven organizations. I research how businesses create and use data products. I am also interested in how they manage their technology stack to support data science projects.
Whenever I find the time, I build open-source projects. These projects address the problems I have in the first place: I want to own and control my data.</description>
