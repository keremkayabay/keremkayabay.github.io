      <description>Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is a free and open-source editor available for Windows, Linux, and macOS. I currently use VSCode for coding in Python, taking markdown notes, and also editing this blog. I like VSCode because of the open-source extensions that you can use to tailor-make workspaces for the development context. In this post, I share a method to give VSCode Overleaf-like capabilities. It requires some time investment, but you can get many paid features of Overleaf for free.</description>

      <description>We couldn&amp;rsquo;t reach the information we wanted a long time ago. While that&amp;rsquo;s no longer the case, today, we struggle with different problems: Maintaining focus and discovering critical information in noise and clutter. Here I share some of the tricks I employ to overcome these problems. My intention is to update this post, adding more apps and tips.
Web browsers Be careful about the amount of time you spend on web sites, especially the addictive ones.</description>

      <title>Planning vs Preparation</title>

      <description>You do planning to design the set of actions to achieve a goal.
You do preparation to get ready for some future goal.
Both are important. But the famous quote goes: &amp;ldquo;Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.&amp;rdquo; If your plans need to change during execution, the number of required modifications, and how well you carry out those modifications depend on your preparation.</description>

      <description>I am a researcher and developer active in data science and information systems domains. My current research is about finding ways to help transform data-disadvantaged (or underachiever) organizations to use data more effectively. Whenever I find the time, I develop open-source projects that address some of my problems.
In this blog, you will find my latest findings. I also write here to clarify my thoughts. You can check out my research at Google Scholar and my projects at GitHub.</description>
