      <description>You do planning to design the set of actions to achieve a goal.
You do preparation to get ready for some future goal.
Both are important. But the famous quote goes: &amp;ldquo;Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.&amp;rdquo; If your plans need to change during execution, the number of required modifications, and how well you carry out those modifications depend on your preparation.</description>

      <description>I am a researcher and developer active in data science and information systems domains. My current research is about finding ways to help transform data-disadvantaged (or underachiever) organizations to use data more effectively. Whenever I find the time, I develop open-source projects that address some of my problems.
In this blog, you will find my latest findings. I also write here to clarify my thoughts. You can check out my research at Google Scholar and my projects at GitHub.</description>
